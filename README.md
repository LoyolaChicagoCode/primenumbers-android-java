# Background

The goal of this example is to demonstrate the tradeoffs found in
the mobile + cloud architecture, where one has a choice between
doing work locally (on the mobile device) versus remotely (in 
the cloud) with different performance considerations in each case.

This is a very rough initial attempt and still needs significant work.

# Learning Objectives

* TODO...

# Running the Application

* Android: as usual through Eclipse

# TODO

* improve UI
* improve architecture
* architectural diagram
* testing
* define task in a way that it can be decomposed! 
  (e.g. each task to check divisibility within a specific range)
